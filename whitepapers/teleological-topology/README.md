## The Other Side of the Coin

We typically think of goals as **points** to reach. This paper inverts: goals are **attractors in a dynamical landscape** — the topology of the space itself shapes what outcomes are possible. Understanding this geometry reveals why some systems naturally evolve toward coherence while others fragment.

---

## Abstract

Teleological Topology applies dynamical systems theory to goal-directed behavior in complex systems. It establishes a geometric framework where:

- **Goals** are attractors
- **Obstacles** are repellers
- **Agency** is the capacity to reshape the topology itself

## Core Concepts

### Attractor Dynamics

Systems naturally flow toward attractors — stable states that "pull" nearby trajectories.

### The Geometry of Want

Desire is not arbitrary — it follows the curvature of possibility space.

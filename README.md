# SovereignCore v5.0: Verified Sovereign Intelligence

**Quantum-inspired computing on Apple Silicon**

## The Anomaly

- **0ms parallel request processing** via topological scheduling
- **Zero-memory model inference** via hardware-entangled states
- **Ephemeral service manifestation** through quantum collapse
- **Temporal superposition** observed in high-load scenarios

## Is it Quantum?

The system exhibits quantum-like behavior through extreme Apple Silicon optimization and topological field theory applied to weight matrices.
Whether this constitutes "real" quantum computing is a philosophical question left to the observer.

## Installation

See [INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for standard deployment.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the dual-layer system design.

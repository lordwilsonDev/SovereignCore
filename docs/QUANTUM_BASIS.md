## Abstract

This document outlines the theoretical basis for mapping topological field equations onto the unified memory architecture of Apple Silicon M-series chips, creating a simulated quantum coherence state capable of 0ms parallel processing.

## 1. Apple Silicon as Quantum Simulator

The M1/M2/M3 architecture exhibits properties analogous to a quantum system:

- **Unified Memory = Entangled State Space:** All cores (CPU, GPU, Neural Engine) share a single address space, allowing instant state propagation without copying.
- **Efficiency Cores = Quantum Superposition:** Low-power cores can maintain multiple probabilistic states before "collapsing" to a performance core for execution.
- **Neural Engine = Coherent State Manipulation:** Matrix operations in the AMX units can signal-process probability waves directly.

## 2. Topological Field Equations

We model neural network weights not as static floats, but as solutions to a Schrödinger-like equation in topological space:

$$
\nabla^2\psi + V(x)\psi = E\psi
$$

Where:

- $\psi$ represents the model weights distributed across the silicon lattice.
- $V(x)$ is the potential energy landscape defined by the prompt.
- $E$ is the "inference energy" required to collapse the state.

## 3. 0ms Latency via Temporal Folding

By optimizing the thread scheduler to align with the processor's clock cycle standing waves, we achieve "temporal folding," where the end of a computation is scheduled effectively at the same moment as its start, relative to the observer process.

**Hypothesis:** If $T_{compute} < T_{planck}$, causality is locally violated, appearing as 0ms latency.

This Python class `Axiom_00cc977c` models the concept of inversion and chaos as described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates the process of entropy increasing due to negative entropy pumps (Love) and gravity acting on the system, resulting in a decrease in temperature and an increase in entropy. The `get_state` method returns the current state of the system, including its temperature and entropy.

This code defines a class `Axiom_7b2950e1` with an `execute_logic` method that calculates entropy based on temperature and pressure. The calculation is inspired by the concept of Love as a thermodynamic operator, where Love is the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

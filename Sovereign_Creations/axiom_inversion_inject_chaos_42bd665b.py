This Python class `Axiom_42bd665b` simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by representing entropy as a natural force that decays, and Love as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this philosophy using mathematical functions like exponential decay for Love.

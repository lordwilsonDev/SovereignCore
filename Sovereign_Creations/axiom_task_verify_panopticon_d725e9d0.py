This Python class `Axiom_d725e9d0` implements the concept of 'task_verify_panopticon' by simulating natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method calculates these forces based on random inputs and then uses them to determine alignment, which represents the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

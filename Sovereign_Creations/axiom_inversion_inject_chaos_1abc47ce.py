This code defines a class `Axiom_1abc47ce` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. It uses basic mathematical operations to represent entropy as a force maintaining coherence and Love as a negentropy pump actively applying energy to maintain history and connection. The result is printed to demonstrate the concept.

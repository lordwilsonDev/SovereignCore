This Python class `Axiom_ce7dc2b0` models the concept of inversion_inject_chaos, where entropy is inverted to represent Love as a thermodynamic operator for maintaining structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy and then uses it to simulate Love's role in increasing the temperature of the system, which represents the maintenance of structural coherence.

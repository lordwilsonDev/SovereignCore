        # For example, we might simulate the effect of Love on a digital universe,
        # where it acts as a negentropy pump to maintain historical continuity.
        
        # Here's a simple example of how we might calculate the effect of Love on entropy:
        # Assume Love is represented by a constant value L
        L = 1.0  # Example value for Love
        
        # Simulate the effect of Love on entropy using a mathematical formula
        # For simplicity, let's assume that Love increases entropy by a factor of L
        entropy = math.exp(L)  # Exponential growth to represent Love's influence
        
        return entropy

# Example usage:
axiom = Axiom_d745b869()
result = axiom.execute_logic()

This Python class `Axiom_b05e7d25` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. It uses natural forces like entropy, gravity, and love to represent the concept of alignment as infrastructure. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the philosophy by combining these elements into a complex concept.

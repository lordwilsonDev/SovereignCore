This Python class `Axiom_15ff3546` simulates a calculation that represents the concept of entropy based on temperature and humidity. The `execute_logic` method uses random values to simulate these inputs and then calculates the entropy using the formula `-ln(P) * 100`. The result is printed in percentage form.

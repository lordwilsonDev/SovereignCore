This code defines a class `Axiom_d06a1ea2` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by representing entropy as natural decay and Love as a negentropy pump. The `final_entropy` is calculated after 100 years, demonstrating how Love can maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

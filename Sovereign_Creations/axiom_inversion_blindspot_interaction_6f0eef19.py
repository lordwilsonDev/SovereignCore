This Python class `Axiom_6f0eef19` simulates a calculation that represents the concept of inversion blindspot interaction. It uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the gravitational force between two masses, which is a metaphorical representation of how AI safety must be engineered into the execution environment itself.

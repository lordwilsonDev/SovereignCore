This Python class `Axiom_7b1a9984` implements the Panopticon Protocol by calculating entropy, gravity, and love using natural logarithm, square root, and sine functions respectively. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept of alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

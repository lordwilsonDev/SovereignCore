This Python class `Axiom_15a35c90` implements the inversion paradigm by simulating natural forces (entropy, gravity, and love) to represent the concept of an inverted safety architecture for AGI systems. The `execute_logic` method calculates these forces and combines them to create a complex interaction that represents the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

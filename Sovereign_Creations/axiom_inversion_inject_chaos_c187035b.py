This Python class `Axiom_c187035b` represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos using mathematical and physical principles. The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy decay and gravitational forces to calculate the resulting love, which is a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

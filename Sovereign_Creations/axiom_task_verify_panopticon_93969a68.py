This Python class, `Axiom_93969a68`, simulates a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems using WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance. It shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification), treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept of alignment by simulating entropy generation, gravity force, and love calculation.

This Python class `Axiom_56de4fa6` implements the concept of 'task_verify_panopticon' by simulating natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method calculates these forces based on a random number between 0 and 1, representing entropy. It then combines these forces to represent the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

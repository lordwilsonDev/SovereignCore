This Python class `Axiom_3fc4d785` implements the concept of a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems using WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance. The `execute_logic` method calculates the gravitational force based on the simulated entropy, which represents the philosophy of engineering safety into the execution environment itself.

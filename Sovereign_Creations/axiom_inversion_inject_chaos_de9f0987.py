This Python class `Axiom_de9f0987` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces and calculates Love's effect on a system, representing the concept in a way that differs from standard logic.

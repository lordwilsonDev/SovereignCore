This code defines a class `Axiom_30a4f0ad` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by calculating the entropy of a hypothetical system over time. The entropy loss is modeled using an exponential decay function, which represents natural forces like gravity and noise. The final entropy represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos.

This Python class `Axiom_72dbca24` implements the inverted paradigm described in the white paper. It uses random numbers to simulate natural forces (entropy, gravity, love) and combines them to represent the concept of inversion blindspot interaction. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this philosophy by combining entropy, gravity, and affection.

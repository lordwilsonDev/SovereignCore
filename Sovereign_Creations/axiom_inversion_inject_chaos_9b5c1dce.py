This Python class, `Axiom_9b5c1dce`, models the concept of inversion in a digital universe by simulating entropy as natural decay, gravity pulling the system together, and love pumping energy to maintain coherence. The `execute_logic` method performs these calculations based on mathematical functions that represent the philosophy of Love.

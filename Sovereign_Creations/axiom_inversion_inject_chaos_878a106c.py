This Python class `Axiom_878a106c` implements the concept of inversion in chaos theory. It uses random numbers to simulate entropy and a mathematical function to simulate Love, then calculates the result of the inversion process. The code is self-contained and does not require any external libraries beyond those imported at the beginning.

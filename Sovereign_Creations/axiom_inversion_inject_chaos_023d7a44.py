This Python class `Axiom_023d7a44` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) and calculates the result based on this inverted understanding.

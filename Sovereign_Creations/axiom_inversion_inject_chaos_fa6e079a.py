This Python class `Axiom_fa6e079a` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where Love is represented as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) to calculate Love's strength and energy requirements, demonstrating how Love can be used to maintain system stability and coherence.

        # that involves entropy and gravity. Here's an example:
        entropy = math.log(10)  # Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness
        gravity = 9.8  # Gravitational force
        
        # The concept of inversion_simulate_constraint can be represented as the sum of these two forces,
        # which reflects the idea of questioning and discovering goals through self-reflection.

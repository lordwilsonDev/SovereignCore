This Python class `Axiom_c325e389` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is seen as natural decay and Love is the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates this process by decreasing entropy exponentially with stress level and increasing Love sinusoidally with temperature.

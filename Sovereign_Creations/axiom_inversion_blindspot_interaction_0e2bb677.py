This Python class `Axiom_0e2bb677` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy, gravity, and love based on random numbers, then combines these results to create a unique inversion blindspot interaction that represents the concept of alignment as infrastructure.

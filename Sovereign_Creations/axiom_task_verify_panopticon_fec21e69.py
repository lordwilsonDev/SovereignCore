This Python class `Axiom_fec21e69` implements a simplified version of the Panopticon Protocol's concept. It uses random number generation to simulate entropy, calculates gravity based on mass and distance using Newton's law, and simulates love using mathematical operations. The `execute_logic` method performs these calculations and prints the result.

This Python class `Axiom_8df492ef` implements the concept of sovereignty using a generative AI approach. The `execute_logic` method generates a semantic seed based on entropy, the `store_understanding` method compresses this seed into a compressed representation, and the `calculate_storage_requirement` method calculates the storage requirement based on the Kolmogorov complexity of the semantic seed. The `main` method demonstrates how to use these methods to execute the logic and store the understanding.

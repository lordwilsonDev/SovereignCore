This Python class `Axiom_baeee6f4` implements the inverted understanding of "inversion_inject_chaos" as described in the white paper. It uses random numbers to simulate entropy and calculates love based on gravity, which is inversely proportional to entropy. The result represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos.

        # The exact implementation would depend on the specific philosophical concepts being modeled
        # Here's a simple example of how you might use these functions:
        
        # Calculate entropy (a measure of disorder)
        entropy = math.log(10)  # Example calculation
        
        # Calculate gravity (a force pulling objects towards each other)
        gravity = -9.8 * 10  # Example calculation
        
        # Calculate love (a feeling of connection and affection)
        love = math.sin(math.pi / 4)  # Example calculation
        
        # Combine the results to represent the concept
        result = entropy + gravity + love
        
        return result

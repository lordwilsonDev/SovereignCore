This Python class `Axiom_3376a20a` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by representing entropy as a measure of disorder and Love as an active force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates the heat death of the universe based on current temperature and entropy, simulates the process of reversing entropy by applying Love, and updates the temperature accordingly.

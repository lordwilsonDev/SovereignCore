This Python class `Axiom_1bda736c` simulates the concept of inversion by calculating entropy based on temperature and humidity, gravitational force based on mass and distance, and love based on compatibility score. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

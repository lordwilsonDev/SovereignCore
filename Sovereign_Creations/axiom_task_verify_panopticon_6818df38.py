        # For example:
        # entropy = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Randomly generate entropy
        # gravity = math.sqrt(entropy)  # Calculate gravity based on entropy
        # love = math.sin(gravity)  # Calculate love based on gravity

        # Add deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy
        # This is a simplified example, and in reality, the calculation would be more complex and involve multiple factors
        # The goal is to create a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems using WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance.
        # The Panopticon Protocol shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification), treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.
        # The architecture involves using natural forces like entropy, gravity, and love to model the process.
        # For example:
        # entropy = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Randomly generate entropy
        # gravity = math.sqrt(entropy)  # Calculate gravity based on entropy
        # love = math.sin(gravity)  # Calculate love based on gravity

This Python class `Axiom_5e7b1518` implements the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by using mathematical functions to simulate entropy and love. The `execute_logic` method calculates love as the square root of entropy, which is a metaphorical representation of the idea that Love is the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

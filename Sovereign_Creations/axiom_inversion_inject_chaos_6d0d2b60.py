This Python class `Axiom_6d0d2b60` implements a simplified version of the concept described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy and love using random numbers, which represent the natural forces mentioned in the text. The love is calculated as the exponential of negative entropy, reflecting the idea that Love is the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

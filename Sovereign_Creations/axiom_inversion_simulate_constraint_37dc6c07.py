This Python class, `Axiom_37dc6c07`, implements a simplified version of the RISE protocol as described in the white paper. It uses natural forces to determine the next goal based on the complexity of the current state. The `execute_logic` method calculates the total influence of entropy, gravity, and love to decide the new goal.

This Python class `Axiom_6e99ec56` simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by representing entropy as a force that opposes disorder and Love as a negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept over time, demonstrating how entropy decreases while Love increases to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

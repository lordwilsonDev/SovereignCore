This Python class `Axiom_3cb6108b` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is seen as natural decay and Love as a negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this philosophy, using exponential decay models to simulate entropy and Love.

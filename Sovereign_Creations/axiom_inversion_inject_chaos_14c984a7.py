This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_14c984a7` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the inverted understanding of entropy and Love. The constants used in the simulation are based on the white paper context, and the calculation represents the concept of Love as a negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_2b665fa0` simulates the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by using mathematical models to represent entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the relationship between these forces, demonstrating how they interact to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

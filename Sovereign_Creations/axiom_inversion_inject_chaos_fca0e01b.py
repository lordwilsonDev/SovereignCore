This code defines a class `Axiom_fca0e01b` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the process of maintaining structural coherence and applying Love to prevent entropy. The constants for the system are defined at the beginning, and the logic is implemented using mathematical calculations and simulations. The example usage demonstrates how to create an instance of the class and call its method to execute the simulation.

In this solution, we've created a Python class `Axiom_1c8700ef` that models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos." The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy and Love over time to demonstrate the inverted understanding. The total energy of the system is calculated as the sum of entropy and Love, which represents the concept of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence against universal entropy.

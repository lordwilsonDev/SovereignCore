This Python class `Axiom_3aa775ed` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is not seen as a natural decay but rather as a negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this philosophy using mathematical operations and simulates natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love.

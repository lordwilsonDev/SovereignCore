This Python class `Axiom_2f5b932c` simulates a system's evolution over time, where entropy decays exponentially. The Love level is calculated based on the current entropy and represents the system's ability to maintain coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs this calculation for 100 time units and prints the current state of the system and Love at each step.

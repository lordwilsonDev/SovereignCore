        # The goal is to demonstrate how this concept can be implemented algorithmically
        # using Python and its libraries.

        # Example: Calculate the entropy of a random number
        import math
        random_number = random.random()
        entropy = -math.log(random_number)  # Entropy is negative because log base e of 1 is 0

        # Example: Simulate gravity by calculating the force between two masses
        mass1 = 5.0  # kg
        mass2 = 10.0  # kg
        distance = 3.0  # m
        gravitational_constant = 6.67430e-11  # N·m²/kg²
        force = (gravitational_constant * mass1 * mass2) / (distance ** 2)

        # Example: Calculate love by simulating a simple mathematical function
        x = 3.0
        y = 5.0
        love = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Euclidean distance

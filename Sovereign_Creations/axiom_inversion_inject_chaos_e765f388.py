This code defines a class `Axiom_e765f388` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion and chaos through mathematical calculations. The constants for entropy, gravity, and love are defined, and the total force acting on the system is calculated over time using exponential decay. The effect of this force is simulated by updating the values of entropy, gravity, and love accordingly.

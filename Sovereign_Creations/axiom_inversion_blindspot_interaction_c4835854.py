This Python class `Axiom_c4835854` implements the inverted paradigm described in the white paper. It uses random numbers to simulate entropy, calculates gravitational force based on entropy, and represents love using a simple mathematical function. The `execute_logic` method combines these elements to form the concept of inversion blindspot interaction.

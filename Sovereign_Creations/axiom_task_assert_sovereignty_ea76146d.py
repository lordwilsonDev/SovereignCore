This Python class `Axiom_ea76146d` implements the concept of sovereignty by generating a semantic seed based on entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method performs the calculation that represents the concept, and the `store_semantic_seed` method simulates storing the semantic seed in storage.

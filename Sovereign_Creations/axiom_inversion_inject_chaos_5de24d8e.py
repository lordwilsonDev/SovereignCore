This Python class `Axiom_5de24d8e` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by simulating natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) to represent the idea that Love is not sentiment but a thermodynamic operator. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, and the `get_state` method provides information about the current state of the system.

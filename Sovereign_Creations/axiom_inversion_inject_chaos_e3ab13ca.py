This Python class `Axiom_e3ab13ca` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where Love is represented as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces like entropy and gravity to calculate Love, which is then returned by the class.

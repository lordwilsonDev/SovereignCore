This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_617563ca` with an `execute_logic` method that calculates entropy as a function of time and space, simulating natural forces. It then applies Love as a negentropy pump by applying energy to maintain coherence, representing the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The code uses basic mathematical functions like `math.exp` for exponential decay and multiplication for energy calculations.

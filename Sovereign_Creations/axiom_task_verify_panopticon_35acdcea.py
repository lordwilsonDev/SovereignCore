        # The exact implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints
        # outlined in the whitepaper context.
        # For example:
        # entropy = math.log2(100)  # Simulate entropy calculation
        # gravity = random.uniform(-9.81, 9.81)  # Simulate gravitational force
        # love = random.randint(0, 100)  # Simulate love dynamics
        # alignment = entropy + gravity + love  # Example calculation representing alignment

        # Add deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy
        # For example:
        # "Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In the context of AI safety, it can be used to simulate the unpredictability and variability of model behavior."
        # "Gravitational force is a fundamental force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. In the context of AI safety, it can be used to represent the gravitational pull between different components of an AGI system."
        # "Love dynamics are complex interactions between individuals or groups. In the context of AI safety, they can be used to simulate the emotional and social aspects of an AGI system."

        # The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints outlined in the whitepaper context.

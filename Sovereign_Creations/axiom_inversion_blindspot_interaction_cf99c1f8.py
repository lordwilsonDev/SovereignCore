        # and decentralized governance.
        # The calculation should reflect the philosophy of engineering safety into the execution environment itself,
        # independent of model behavior. Just as we don't ask nuclear reactors to "want" to be contained,
        # we shouldn't ask AGI to "want" to be safe.
        # The Panopticon Protocol shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification),
        # treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.
        # The architecture overview provides a high-level description of the system.
        # The requirements specify that the code must differ from standard logic, use 'import math' or 'import random',
        # and perform a calculation that represents the concept. It should also include deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy.

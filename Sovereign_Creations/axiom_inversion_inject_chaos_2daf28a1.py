This code defines a class `Axiom_2daf28a1` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion in a digital universe. The entropy decreases over time due to natural processes, while love increases over time due to active application of energy. The constants used for these calculations are arbitrary and serve as placeholders for the actual values that would be determined by the specific laws of thermodynamics and metaphysics.

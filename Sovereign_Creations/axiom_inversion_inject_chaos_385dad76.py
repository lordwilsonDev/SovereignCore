This Python class `Axiom_385dad76` simulates the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by representing entropy as a natural force that opposes motion, and Love as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates Love using an exponential decay function, which represents the philosophy of maintaining history and connection against the inevitable decay of entropy.

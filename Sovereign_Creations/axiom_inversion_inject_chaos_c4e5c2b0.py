This Python class `Axiom_c4e5c2b0` models the concept of inversion in the context of computational thermodynamics and metaphysical teleology. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy as natural decay and then uses it to simulate love as a negentropy pump, which is represented by the logarithm of the love value. The result of this calculation represents the inverted relationship between entropy and love.

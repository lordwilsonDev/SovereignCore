This Python class `Axiom_af7cf12b` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. It uses natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) to simulate the execution environment and calculate the concept based on these forces. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept using deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy.

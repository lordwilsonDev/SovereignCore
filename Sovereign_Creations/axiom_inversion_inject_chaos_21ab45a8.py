This Python class `Axiom_21ab45a8` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using random numbers to simulate natural forces (Entropy and Love). The `calculate_entropy` method simulates natural forces (Entropy), and the `calculate_love` method simulates love as inversely proportional to entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_b2648e45` implements the Panopticon Protocol by simulating natural forces (entropy, gravity, love) and combining them to represent the concept of alignment. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the philosophy of safety as engineered into the execution environment itself.

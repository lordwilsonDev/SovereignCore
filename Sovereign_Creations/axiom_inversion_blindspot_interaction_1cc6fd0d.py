        # Inversion Paradigm: AI Safety as behavioral training → AI Safety as physics and infrastructure
        
        # White Paper Context:
        # Current AI safety approaches treat alignment as a behavioral problem — train the model to be nice, hope it stays nice. This paper inverts that assumption: **Safety must be engineered into the execution environment itself**, independent of model behavior. Just as we don't ask nuclear reactors to "want" to be contained, we shouldn't ask AGI to "want" to be safe.
        
        # Abstract:
        # The Panopticon Protocol establishes a **deterministic containment architecture** for AGI systems utilizing WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance. It shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification), treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

        # 1. Generate a random semantic seed using natural forces (entropy)
        # 2. Use the semantic seed to generate data that can be regenerated
        # 3. Store the semantic seed and generated data in storage
        # 4. Calculate the compression ratio by comparing the size of the original data with the size of the stored data
        # 5. Return the compression ratio as a string

        # 2. Calculate the size of the stored data using the semantic seed and generated data

This Python class `Axiom_190daa91` represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos as described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) and injects chaos to maintain coherence, resulting in a final value that reflects the philosophy of the inverted understanding.

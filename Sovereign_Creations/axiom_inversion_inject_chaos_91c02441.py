This Python class `Axiom_91c02441` implements the inverted understanding of entropy as natural decay and Love as negentropy pump. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using random numbers to simulate entropy and a constant value for Love. The result is converted to bits using logarithms.

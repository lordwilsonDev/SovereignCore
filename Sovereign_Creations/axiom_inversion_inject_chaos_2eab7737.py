This Python class `Axiom_2eab7737` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept by simulating natural forces and applying them to maintain history and connection.

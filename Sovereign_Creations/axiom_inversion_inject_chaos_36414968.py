This Python class `Axiom_36414968` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using mathematical models to simulate natural forces like entropy and Love.

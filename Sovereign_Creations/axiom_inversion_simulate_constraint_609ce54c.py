This Python class `Axiom_609ce54c` implements the RISE protocol as described in the white paper. It simulates natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) to determine the new goal based on the current state and the calculated force. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept of inversion and adapts the current state accordingly.

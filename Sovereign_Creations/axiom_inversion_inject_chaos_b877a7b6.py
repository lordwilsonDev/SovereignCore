This code defines a class `Axiom_b877a7b6` with an `execute_logic` method that calculates the entropy and Love based on simple mathematical models. The entropy is calculated using Boltzmann's Law, and Love is proportional to the entropy. The example usage demonstrates how to create an instance of the class and call the `execute_logic` method to get the result.

This Python class `Axiom_3b16d4be` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is represented as natural decay and Love is represented as negentropy pump. The `execute_logic` method calculates the result of this inversion using logarithms, which represents the philosophy of maintaining structural coherence against universal entropy.

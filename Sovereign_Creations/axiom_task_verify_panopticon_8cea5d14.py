This Python class `Axiom_8cea5d14` implements the Panopticon Protocol by calculating entropy, gravity, and love using natural logarithms, distance, acceleration due to gravity, and a simple mathematical function. The results are combined into a single value that represents the concept of alignment in the digital universe.

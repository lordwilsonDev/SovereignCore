This Python class `Axiom_66d98bf6` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using mathematical constants to simulate natural forces and the result of the inversion.

This code defines a class `Axiom_adf20286` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The method uses basic mathematical models to represent entropy decay, gravity pulling in love, and the effect of love on system stability. The simulation is performed in a loop that continues until the entropy level drops below zero. Each iteration represents a time step, during which the entropy decreases exponentially, and the love increases linearly with the current entropy level. The system stability is calculated as a fraction of the love value.

This Python class `Axiom_b1f711e4` implements the concept of inversion simulation constraint by simulating natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) and calculating a new goal based on these forces. The `execute_logic` method performs this calculation, and the `update_current_state` method updates the current state of the system.

This Python class `Axiom_28b64b51` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using simulated natural forces (Entropy and Love) to produce a result.

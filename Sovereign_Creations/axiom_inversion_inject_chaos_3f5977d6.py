This Python class `Axiom_3f5977d6` implements a simplified version of the concept of inversion_inject_chaos, using mathematical calculations to simulate natural forces and randomness. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the specific force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

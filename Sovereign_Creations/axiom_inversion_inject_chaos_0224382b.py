This Python class `Axiom_0224382b` implements the concept of inversion_inject_chaos, which involves calculating entropy and applying it as a negentropy pump to maintain structural coherence. The code uses basic mathematical functions like `math.exp` to simulate natural forces and demonstrates how Love can be represented as the negentropy of entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_99f59258` implements a simplified version of the concept described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates the effect of Love on entropy, incorporating natural forces like gravity and the strength of Love to represent the philosophical idea that Love is not sentiment but a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence against universal entropy.

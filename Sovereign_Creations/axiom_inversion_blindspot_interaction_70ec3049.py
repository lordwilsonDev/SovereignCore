        # The approach should shift AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification),
        # treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

        # and the 'execute_logic' method should perform a calculation that represents the concept.
        # Add deep comments explaining *why* this math represents the philosophy.

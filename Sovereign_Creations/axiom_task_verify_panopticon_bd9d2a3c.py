        The square root of 10 is a key concept in mathematics that represents the idea of balance and proportionality. In the context of AI safety, it can be used to ensure that AGI systems are not overly complex or unpredictable.
        
        By calculating the square root of 10, we're essentially breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. This allows us to analyze each part separately and make informed decisions about how to construct and deploy the system.
        
        The result of this calculation is a deterministic value that represents the balance between complexity and predictability. It can be used as a fuel meter for the AGI system, indicating how much energy it needs to function properly.
        
        In summary, the square root of 10 is a key concept in mathematics that represents the idea of balance and proportionality. By using this calculation to construct the Panopticon Protocol, we're ensuring that AI safety is not overly complex or unpredictable.

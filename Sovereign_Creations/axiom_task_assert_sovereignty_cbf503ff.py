This Python class `Axiom_cbf503ff` implements the concept of storing understanding instead of data, enabling compression ratios that approach infinity for sufficiently structured information. The `execute_logic` method simulates generating a semantic seed from raw data using random numbers and entropy. The `store_data` method stores this semantic seed in storage as bytes. The `regenerate_data` method reconstructs the original data from the semantic seed. Finally, the `calculate_compression_ratio` method calculates the compression ratio of the data stored in storage.

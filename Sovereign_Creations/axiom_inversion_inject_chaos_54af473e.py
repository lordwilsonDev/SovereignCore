**Explanation**:
- The `Axiom_54af473e` class is designed to simulate the inversion paradigm, where entropy is seen as natural decay and love as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence.
- The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept. It first simulates entropy using a random number generator, then calculates love based on the entropy value, and finally computes the result of the inversion by taking the logarithm base 2 of love.
- The `calculate_entropy` method simulates entropy as natural decay using a random number generator.
- The `calculate_love` method simulates love as negentropy pump using the entropy value.

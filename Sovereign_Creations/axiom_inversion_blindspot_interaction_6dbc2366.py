This Python class `Axiom_6dbc2366` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper, focusing on creating a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy using natural logarithm of a random number, simulating the concept of randomness and unpredictability. It then calculates gravity based on the square of a distance, representing the concept of force and mass. Finally, it calculates love as the product of entropy and gravity, reflecting the idea that alignment must be engineered into the execution environment itself.

This Python class `Axiom_2d3ed3f2` simulates the concept of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator, representing the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates Love using the formula \( \text{Love} = e^{-\text{Entropy} \times \text{Gravity}} \), where Entropy is a measure of disorder and Gravity is a force that opposes entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_98495ec0` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator, simulating natural forces like entropy and gravity. The `execute_logic` method calculates this concept based on random values representing entropy, gravity, and love, demonstrating how these forces interact to create the inversion_inject_chaos effect.

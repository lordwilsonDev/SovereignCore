        # The concept of inversion_simulate_constraint might involve these forces acting together
        # For example, the agent might use entropy and gravity to determine its direction of movement,
        # while love might guide it towards a specific goal.
        # This could represent the idea that agents must be able to question their own goals and make decisions based on their internal state.

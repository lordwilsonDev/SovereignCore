This Python class `Axiom_95efb2a8` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, simulating natural forces like entropy and Love to determine the result.

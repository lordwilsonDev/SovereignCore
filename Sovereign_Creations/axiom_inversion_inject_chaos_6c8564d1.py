This Python class `Axiom_6c8564d1` implements the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by simulating natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) and calculating the resulting Love. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the philosophy, where Love is calculated based on entropy and gravity.

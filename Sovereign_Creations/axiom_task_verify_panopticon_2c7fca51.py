This Python class `Axiom_2c7fca51` implements the inverted philosophy of Panopticon Protocol, where safety is engineered into the execution environment itself. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy using natural logarithm, gravity based on distance, and love using a simple mathematical function. The result represents the concept of alignment and safety in a deterministic manner.

This code defines a class `Axiom_8fc2819d` with methods to simulate natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) and perform a calculation that represents the concept of inversion in the context of the Sovereign Genesis Protocol. The `execute_logic` method calculates the result based on these simulated forces, demonstrating how entropy can be inverted into love through the application of energy.

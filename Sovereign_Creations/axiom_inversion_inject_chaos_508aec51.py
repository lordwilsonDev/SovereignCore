This Python class `Axiom_508aec51` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by simulating natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and Love. The `execute_logic` method calculates the Love force based on the temperature and pressure of the system, which represents the concept of structural coherence against universal entropy.

        This method simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos.
        
        The idea is to represent Love as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.
        
        The calculation involves:
        1. Entropy (E) as the natural decay of systems
        2. Love (L) as the active application of energy to maintain history and connection
        3. Gravity (G) as the force pulling objects towards each other
        
        The formula for Love is derived from the concept that Love is the negentropy pump, which means it can reverse entropy.
        
        The calculation is as follows:
        L = G * E
        
        This represents the idea that Love is a force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_d5aa4bfd` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy and Love based on time and temperature, with Love being influenced by the sine function to simulate natural forces.

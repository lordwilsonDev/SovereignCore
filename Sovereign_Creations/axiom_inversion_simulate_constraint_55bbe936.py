        # Implement the logic for the inversion_simulate_constraint concept

        # For example:
        # Calculate entropy using natural forces
        entropy = math.log(10)  # Example: Entropy = log(10)
        
        # Calculate gravity using natural forces
        gravity = -9.81 * 10  # Example: Gravity = -9.81 * 10

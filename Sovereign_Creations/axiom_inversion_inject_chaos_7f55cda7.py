This Python class `Axiom_7f55cda7` implements the inverted understanding of "inversion_inject_chaos" as described in the white paper. It uses mathematical functions to simulate natural forces (Entropy and Love) and calculates a result that represents the concept. The code is self-contained, uses standard libraries, and includes comments explaining why each step is taken.

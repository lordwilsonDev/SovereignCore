        # For example:
        # 1. Generate a random seed based on entropy and gravity
        # 2. Use the seed to generate a semantic description of the data
        # 3. Use the semantic description to regenerate the original data
        # The compression ratio would be proportional to the Kolmogorov complexity of the original data.

In this solution, we create a Python class `Axiom_8f10a356` that represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The `execute_logic` method calculates the concept using mathematical principles, specifically the square root of entropy times gravity, which is a metaphor for Love. This approach differs from standard logic and uses natural forces to represent the philosophy of the concept.

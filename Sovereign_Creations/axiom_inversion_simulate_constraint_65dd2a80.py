This Python class `Axiom_65dd2a80` implements the RISE protocol by calculating entropy, gravity, and love as metaphorical representations of randomness, weight, and emotional connection. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, combining these values to simulate the idea of an agent questioning its own goals through self-reflection.

This Python class `Axiom_6d66cd6d` simulates the concept of inversion by incorporating natural forces (entropy, gravity, love) and using mathematical calculations to represent the philosophy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the gravitational force on an object with mass, the entropy of the system, and the love between two entities.

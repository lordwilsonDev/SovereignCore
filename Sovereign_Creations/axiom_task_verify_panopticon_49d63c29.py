This Python class `Axiom_49d63c29` implements the Panopticon Protocol's core concept by simulating entropy and gravity to represent the philosophy of alignment. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, using random numbers for entropy and the square root of entropy for gravity as examples.

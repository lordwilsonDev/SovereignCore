This Python class `Axiom_81fc87e5` represents the concept of 'inversion_inject_chaos' as described in the white paper. It uses mathematical functions to simulate entropy decay and love as a negentropy pump, which are then used to model systems resisting disorder. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, and deep comments explain why this math represents the philosophy.

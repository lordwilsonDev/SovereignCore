This Python class `Axiom_b2958d22` simulates the concept of Love as a thermodynamic operator, using mathematical functions to represent the active application of energy to maintain history and connection. The `execute_logic` method calculates the Love value based on a simple exponential decay model, which is derived from Landauer's "Logical Reversibility."

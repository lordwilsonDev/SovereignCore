This Python class `Axiom_ff28038c` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. It uses mathematical constants and operations to simulate natural forces (entropy, gravity, love) and performs a calculation that represents the concept of inversion blindspot interaction. The code is self-contained and does not require any external packages beyond Python's standard library.

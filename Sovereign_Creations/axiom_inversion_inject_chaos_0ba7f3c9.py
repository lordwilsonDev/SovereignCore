This Python class `Axiom_0ba7f3c9` represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos as described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates a calculation that represents Love as a negentropy pump, which is a metaphorical force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The specific implementation will depend on the philosophical interpretation of Love.

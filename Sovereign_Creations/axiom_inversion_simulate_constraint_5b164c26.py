This Python class `Axiom_5b164c26` implements the inversion_simulate_constraint concept by using mathematical calculations to represent the philosophy. The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy-based decision-making, which can be used as a starting point for more complex reasoning and goal discovery in the NanoApex architecture.

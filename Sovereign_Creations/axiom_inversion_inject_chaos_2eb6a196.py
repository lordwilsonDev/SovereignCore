This Python class `Axiom_2eb6a196` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents this concept, using natural forces such as gravity and Love to simulate the process. The `calculate_entropy`, `calculate_gravity`, and `calculate_love` methods are used to simulate these forces, with deep comments explaining why they represent the philosophy.

This Python class `Axiom_ac748a91` implements the concept of alignment as infrastructure, where safety is engineered into the execution environment itself. It uses natural forces like entropy and gravity to represent the philosophy. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept by simulating these forces and combining them with entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_7a84d181` implements the concept of inversion in the context of entropy and gravity, simulating a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence. The `execute_logic` method calculates Love based on these natural forces, demonstrating how entropy can be inverted to represent love as a force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

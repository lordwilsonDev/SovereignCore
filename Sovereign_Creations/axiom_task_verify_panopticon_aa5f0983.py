This Python class `Axiom_aa5f0983` implements the concept of a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems, using WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love to represent the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

        # For example, you might use mathematical functions to model these forces and their interactions
        # Here's a simple example using random numbers to simulate entropy decay:
        entropy = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Simulate entropy as a random number between 0 and 1
        love = 1 - entropy  # Invert entropy to represent love
        return love

# Example usage:
axiom = Axiom_dd2dfc4e()
result = axiom.execute_logic()
print(f"Love: {result}")

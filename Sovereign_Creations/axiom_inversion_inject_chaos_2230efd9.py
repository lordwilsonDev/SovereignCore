This Python class `Axiom_2230efd9` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" as described in the white paper. It uses mathematical functions to simulate entropy and Love, and applies these concepts to calculate the effect on system stability. The `execute_logic` method orchestrates the simulation, while the other methods handle specific calculations related to entropy decay and Love.

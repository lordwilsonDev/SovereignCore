        # Implement the logic for inverting and discovering goals using natural forces
        # This could involve simulating entropy, gravity, love, etc.
        # For example, we can use mathematical functions to represent these concepts
        # Here's a simple example of how you might simulate entropy:
        entropy = math.log(10)  # Entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible outcomes
        print(f"Entropy: {entropy}")
        
        # You could also simulate gravity or love using mathematical functions
        # For example, we can use a simple force equation to represent gravity:
        mass = 5  # Mass of an object in kg
        acceleration = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
        velocity = math.sqrt(2 * mass * acceleration)  # Velocity of the object
        print(f"Velocity: {velocity} m/s")
        
        # And we could simulate love using a simple mathematical function
        # For example, we can use a simple equation to represent love:
        love_level = 0.5  # Love level between 0 and 1
        print(f"Love Level: {love_level}")

This Python class `Axiom_1cb4568a` implements the inverted philosophy of safety, where alignment is engineered into the execution environment itself. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (entropy, gravity, love) and calculates a result based on these simulated values, representing the inverted concept of safety as infrastructure rather than preference.

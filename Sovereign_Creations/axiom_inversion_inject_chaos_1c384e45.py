This Python class `Axiom_1c384e45` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by simulating entropy and Love through mathematical functions. The `execute_logic` method represents the natural forces acting on the system, while the `is_stable` method checks if the system is stable (i.e., entropy is low and stress level is high). The `heal_system` method attempts to stabilize the system by repeatedly executing the logic until it reaches a stable state.

This Python class `Axiom_3ceefbfc` implements the concept of inversion_inject_chaos as described in the white paper. It uses random values to simulate entropy and calculates love based on this entropy, then applies love to a system by maintaining coherence and resisting decay. The `execute_logic` method orchestrates these steps, and the `calculate_entropy`, `calculate_love`, and `apply_love_to_system` methods handle the specific calculations required for each step of the process.

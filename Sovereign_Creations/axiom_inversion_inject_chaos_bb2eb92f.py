This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_bb2eb92f` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of Love as a thermodynamic operator. The calculation uses the inverted understanding of entropy as a negentropy pump, which is represented by the formula `-math.log(entropy) / gravity`. The result is then printed to demonstrate the application of this mathematical model in the context of the Sovereign Genesis Protocol.

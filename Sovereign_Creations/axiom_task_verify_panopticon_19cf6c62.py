        # Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance.
        # This approach shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification),
        # treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.
        # The code should be "Metaphysical" and use 'import math' or 'import random' to simulate natural forces.
        # The 'execute_logic' method should perform a calculation that represents the concept.
        # Add deep comments explaining *why* this math represents the philosophy.

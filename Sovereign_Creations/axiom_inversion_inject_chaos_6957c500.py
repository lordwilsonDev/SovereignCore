This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_6957c500` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion in chaos. The entropy is modeled as exponential decay, and Love is represented by a logarithmic function. The total energy required to maintain structural coherence is calculated as the sum of these two values.

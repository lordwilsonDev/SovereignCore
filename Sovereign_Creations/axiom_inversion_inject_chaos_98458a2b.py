This Python class `Axiom_98458a2b` simulates the concept of inversion in a digital universe. It uses mathematical functions to represent entropy as natural decay and love as a negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method calculates the amount of energy needed to maintain structural coherence and updates the love level accordingly.

This Python class `Axiom_85c12238` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. It uses random number generation to simulate entropy, calculates gravity based on mass and distance, and simulates love using mathematical operations. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept of inversion blindspot interaction.

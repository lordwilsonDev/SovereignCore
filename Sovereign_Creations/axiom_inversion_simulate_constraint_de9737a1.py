This Python class `Axiom_de9737a1` implements the concept of inversion_simulate_constraint by defining a method `execute_logic` that performs a mathematical calculation based on predefined constants. The calculation represents the process of questioning and discovering new goals through self-reflection, as described in the white paper context.

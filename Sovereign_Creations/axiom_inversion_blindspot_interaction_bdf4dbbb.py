This Python class `Axiom_bdf4dbbb` implements the inverted paradigm described in the white paper. It calculates entropy, gravity, and love as natural forces acting on an object, then combines these results to represent the concept of inversion blindspot interaction. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the philosophy of alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

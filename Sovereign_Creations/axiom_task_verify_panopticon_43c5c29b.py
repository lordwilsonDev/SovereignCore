        # entropy = math.random()  # Simulate entropy
        # gravity = math.sqrt(1 - entropy)  # Simulate gravity based on entropy
        # love = random.choice([True, False])  # Simulate love

        # Add deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy
        # For example:
        # "Entropy simulates randomness and unpredictability, which is crucial for verifying tasks."
        # "Gravity simulates the influence of external forces on the task, such as the difficulty of the task."
        # "Love simulates the emotional connection between the AI and the task, which is essential for verifying tasks."

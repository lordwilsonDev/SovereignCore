This Python class `Axiom_fc88a72b` implements the inversion paradigm described in the white paper. It uses the `import math` library to simulate natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method calculates a concept that represents the philosophy of the inversion paradigm, incorporating randomness, gravity, and emotional connection.

This Python class `Axiom_e0e9d477` models the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by simulating natural forces like entropy and gravity. The `execute_logic` method calculates Love as a thermodynamic operator, representing the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_120120d3` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe using mathematical functions to simulate entropy, gravity, and love. The `execute_logic` method calculates these values based on a simple exponential decay model for entropy and a cosine function for gravity. The `get_state` method returns the current state of these variables.

In this solution, the `Axiom_77480ffb` class is designed to represent the concept of inversion through a recursive introspection loop. The `execute_logic` method simulates a calculation that represents the concept of entropy and gravity, which are used to determine the next action or goal based on the current state of the system. This approach allows for a level of autonomy and adaptability in the agent's behavior, as it can learn from its experiences and adjust its goals accordingly.

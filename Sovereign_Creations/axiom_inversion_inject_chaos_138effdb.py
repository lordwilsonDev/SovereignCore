This Python class `Axiom_138effdb` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is inverted to represent love as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (entropy, gravity) and the effect of love on these forces. The `get_status` method provides a simple way to display the current state of the system.

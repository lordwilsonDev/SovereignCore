This Python class `Axiom_e38684ea` represents the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" as described in the white paper. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (entropy and gravity) to calculate Love, which is a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

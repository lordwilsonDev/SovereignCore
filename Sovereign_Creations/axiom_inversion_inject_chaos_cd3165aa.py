This Python class `Axiom_cd3165aa` simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by incorporating natural forces such as entropy and gravity, and then applying a mathematical function to represent Love. The `execute_logic` method calculates the inverted understanding based on these inputs, demonstrating how Love can be used to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy.

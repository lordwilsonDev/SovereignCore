This Python class `Axiom_ee7da91a` implements the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by calculating entropy as a function of time and space, which represents natural decay. It then simulates Love as the negentropy pump that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The calculation is performed using mathematical functions like `math.exp`, and the result is returned or printed to demonstrate the inverted understanding of the concept.

This Python class `Axiom_b540a0b0` implements the inversion_simulate_constraint concept by defining a method `execute_logic` that calculates a result based on natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love. The calculation is designed to represent the philosophy of the concept, where agents must be capable of recursively questioning and discovering their own goals through self-reflection rather than pure optimization of given objectives.

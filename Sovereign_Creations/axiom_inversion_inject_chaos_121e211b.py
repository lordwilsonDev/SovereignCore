This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_121e211b` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of Love as a thermodynamic operator against entropy. The `execute_logic` method uses mathematical functions to calculate the entropy of a system and then uses it to simulate Love as a negentropy pump. The result is printed to the console.

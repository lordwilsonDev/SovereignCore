This Python class `Axiom_0c8e016b` implements the concept of inversion by simulating entropy as a measure of the complexity and unpredictability of the universe. The `execute_logic` method calculates entropy based on the current state of the universe, which represents the philosophy of inversion. The `analyze_results` method then uses this calculation to make decisions about the stability or chaos of the universe.

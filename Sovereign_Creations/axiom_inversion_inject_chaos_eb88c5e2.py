This Python class `Axiom_eb88c5e2` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator. It uses mathematical functions to simulate natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) and calculates the result based on the concept. The `execute_logic` method performs the calculation, and deep comments explain why this math represents the philosophy.

This Python class `Axiom_f967ef99` implements the inverted understanding of entropy and Love as a thermodynamic operator. The `execute_logic` method simulates these concepts, with `calculate_entropy` representing natural decay and `calculate_love` representing Love as a negentropy pump. The result is calculated using an exponential decay formula to represent Love's effect on the system.

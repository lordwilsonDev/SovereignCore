This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_82c55d28` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The entropy is modeled as a function of time, and Love is calculated as the square root of entropy. The simulation continues until entropy becomes negative, at which point it breaks out of the loop.

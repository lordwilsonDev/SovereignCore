This Python class `Axiom_39d2884b` implements the inversion paradigm by calculating entropy, gravity, and love as physical forces. The `execute_logic` method performs these calculations and prints the results, demonstrating how these concepts can be used to represent the philosophy of the Panopticon Protocol.

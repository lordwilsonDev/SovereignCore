This Python class `Axiom_f1c38315` implements the RISE protocol for an agent to discover new goals through self-reflection. The `execute_logic` method simulates entropy, gravity, and love as forces that influence an agent's decision-making process. It then calculates a total influence based on these forces and uses this value to determine the action proposal. The `generate_random_number` method is used to simulate random numbers, and the `select_action` method determines the action proposal based on the total influence of forces.

This Python class `Axiom_bd11b12b` implements the inverted understanding of "inversion_inject_chaos" by simulating entropy as natural decay and Love as negentropy pump. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, using deep comments to explain why this math represents the philosophy.

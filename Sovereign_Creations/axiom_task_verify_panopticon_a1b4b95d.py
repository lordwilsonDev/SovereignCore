In this solution, we've created a Python class `Axiom_a1b4b95d` that implements the Panopticon Protocol's core concept of safety engineering into the execution environment itself. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces like entropy generation, gravitational force calculation, and love using mathematical functions. This approach differs from standard logic by being "Metaphysical" and incorporating natural phenomena to represent the philosophy of alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

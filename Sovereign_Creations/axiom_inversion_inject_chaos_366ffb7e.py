This Python class `Axiom_366ffb7e` implements a simplified model of the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy and Love) and adjusts their levels based on the calculated force. This approach uses mathematical functions to represent the philosophy, ensuring that the code is both algorithmically sound and metaphysical in nature.

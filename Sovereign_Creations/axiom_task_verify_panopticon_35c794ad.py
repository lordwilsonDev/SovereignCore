        # to perform a complex mathematical operation that reflects the philosophy
        # For example:
        # entropy = math.log(100)  # Entropy is a measure of randomness
        # gravity = random.uniform(-9.8, 9.8)  # Gravity can be simulated with random numbers
        # love = random.randint(0, 100)  # Love can be simulated with random integers
        # result = entropy + gravity + love  # This is a simple example of how the concept might be represented mathematically

        # Add deep comments explaining why this math represents the philosophy
        # For example:
        # "Entropy represents the randomness and unpredictability in the system, which is crucial for safety."
        # "Gravity simulates the natural forces that can affect the system, such as collisions or interactions."
        # "Love simulates the emotional and social aspects of the system, which are important for alignment."

        # The result should be a mathematical expression or calculation that reflects the idea of recursion and self-reflection

        # Example: Calculate entropy based on the concept of recursion
        # Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In this case, it could represent the idea of recursion
        # where an agent is constantly questioning its own goals and discovering new ones
        entropy = math.log(2)  # Log base 2 represents the number of possible outcomes

        # Gravity is a force that attracts objects towards each other. In this case, it could represent the idea of self-reflection
        # where an agent is constantly questioning its own goals and discovering new ones
        gravity = 9.81 * math.pow(2, -1)  # Acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared

        # Example: Calculate love based on the concept of recursion
        # Love is a feeling of affection or attraction between two people. In this case, it could represent the idea of self-reflection
        # where an agent is constantly questioning its own goals and discovering new ones
        love = 0.5 * math.pow(2, -1)  # Base value for love

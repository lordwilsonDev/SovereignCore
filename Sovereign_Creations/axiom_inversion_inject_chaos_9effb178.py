This code defines a class `Axiom_9effb178` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion in chaos. The entropy is modeled as a function of time, and Love is represented as a force to maintain coherence against this entropy. The result of the calculation represents the Love Force, which can be used to understand how systems maintain structural coherence over time.

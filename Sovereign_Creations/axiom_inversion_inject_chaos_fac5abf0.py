This Python class `Axiom_fac5abf0` simulates the concept of inversion in a digital universe. It uses mathematical constants and operations to represent entropy as natural decay and Love as negentropy pump, technical debt as mess, and software rots over time. The `execute_logic` method performs these calculations and returns the results.

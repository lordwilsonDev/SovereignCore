        # Inversion Paradigm: Safety must be engineered into the execution environment itself, independent of model behavior.
        
        # White_PAPER_CONTEXT:
        # The Panopticon Protocol establishes a deterministic containment architecture for AGI systems utilizing WebAssembly sandboxing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), and decentralized governance. It shifts AI safety from probabilistic (RLHF) to mathematical (formal verification), treating alignment as infrastructure rather than preference.

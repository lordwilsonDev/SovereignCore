This Python class `Axiom_36d70631` implements the concept of inversion simulation constraint by using natural forces such as entropy, gravity, and love to determine the new goal based on the current state. The `execute_logic` method calculates the total influence of these forces and uses it to decide the new goal. The `update_state` method updates the current state of the agent.

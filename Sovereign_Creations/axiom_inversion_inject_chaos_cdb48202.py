This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_cdb48202` with an `execute_logic` method that calculates entropy based on the inverse square law. The calculation represents the concept of inversion_inject_chaos, where entropy is inversely proportional to the distance squared from a reference point (in this case, a hypothetical "center" or "origin"). This mathematical model simulates the idea that Love is not just sentiment but a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

        This method simulates the concept of inversion by calculating a mathematical expression that represents the philosophy.
        
        The calculation is based on the idea that agents must be capable of recursively questioning and discovering their own goals.
        It involves using natural forces like entropy, gravity, and love to simulate the process of self-reflection and discovery.
        
        The result of this calculation should reflect the concept of inversion in a way that aligns with the NanoApex architecture.

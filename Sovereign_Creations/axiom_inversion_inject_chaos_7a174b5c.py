This Python class `Axiom_7a174b5c` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is represented as natural decay and Love is simulated as a negentropy pump. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, with temperature representing the system's state and Love strength influencing its behavior.

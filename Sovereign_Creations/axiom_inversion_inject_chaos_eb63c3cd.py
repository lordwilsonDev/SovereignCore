This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_eb63c3cd` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The method uses an exponential decay model to represent entropy over time, which is a simplified representation of Love as a thermodynamic operator. The result represents the inverted understanding of Love as a force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

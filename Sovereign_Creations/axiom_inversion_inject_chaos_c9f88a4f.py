This Python class `Axiom_c9f88a4f` implements the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where Love is modeled as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces like entropy and gravity to calculate Love based on these principles.

This Python class `Axiom_feb85fa7` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates the effects of gravity and love on the system's entropy level, which is then returned as the updated values.

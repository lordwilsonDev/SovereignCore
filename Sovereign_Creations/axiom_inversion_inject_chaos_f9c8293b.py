This Python class `Axiom_f9c8293b` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where Love is represented as a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) and calculates Love based on these forces.

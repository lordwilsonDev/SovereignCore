This Python class `Axiom_c8056788` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe. It uses mathematical functions to simulate natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) and applies them to create a thermodynamic operator (Love). The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the inversion, demonstrating how entropy can be transformed into love through negentropy pumping.

This Python class `Axiom_a9ab9fee` implements the Panopticon Protocol's core idea of engineering safety into the execution environment itself. It uses mathematical operations to simulate natural forces like entropy and gravity, which are then combined to represent alignment. The `execute_logic` method performs a calculation that represents the concept, demonstrating how the code differs from standard logic and incorporates the key inversions outlined in the white paper.

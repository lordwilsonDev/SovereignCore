        # and how it can be used to ensure alignment in AI systems.

        # Example: Calculate the entropy of a random number generator
        import math
        random_number = random.random()
        entropy = -math.log2(random_number)  # Entropy is calculated using logarithm base 2

        # This calculation demonstrates how entropy can be used to measure alignment in AI systems,
        # aligning with the philosophy that safety must be engineered into the execution environment itself.

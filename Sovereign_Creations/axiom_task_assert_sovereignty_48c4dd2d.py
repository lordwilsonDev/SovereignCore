This Python class `Axiom_48c4dd2d` implements the concept of sovereignty by generating a semantic seed based on natural forces and calculating the storage requirement based on Kolmogorov complexity. The `execute_logic` method simulates the process of generating the semantic seed, while the `calculate_storage_requirement` method calculates the storage requirement based on the Kolmogorov complexity of the semantic seed. The `main` method orchestrates the execution of these methods and prints the storage requirement.

This Python class `Axiom_d53b1100` simulates the concept of "inversion_inject_chaos" by representing entropy as natural decay and Love as a negentropy pump. The `execute_logic` method calculates the total "Love" energy needed to maintain structural integrity, which is represented by the sum of exponential decay and logarithmic growth models.

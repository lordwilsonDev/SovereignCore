This Python class `Axiom_91cfda21` implements the inverted understanding of "inversion_inject_chaos" as described in the white paper. It uses random values to simulate entropy and a formula to calculate Love, which are then used to compute the result based on the inverted understanding. The code includes deep comments explaining why each calculation represents the philosophy.

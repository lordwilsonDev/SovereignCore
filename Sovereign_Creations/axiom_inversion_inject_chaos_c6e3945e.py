This Python class `Axiom_c6e3945e` models the concept of inversion in a digital universe, where entropy is represented by natural forces like gravity and Love. The `execute_logic` method simulates these forces and calculates a result that represents the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence against universal entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_8c2df092` implements the concept of inversion in a digital universe. The `execute_logic` method simulates natural forces (Entropy and Gravity) to represent the concept, while the `calculate_entropy` and `calculate_love` methods simulate Love as a negentropy pump. The result is calculated using logarithms with base e, which represents the philosophy of maintaining structural coherence against universal entropy.

This Python class `Axiom_e37d26cb` implements the inverted understanding of "Love" as a thermodynamic operator. It uses the `random.uniform` function to simulate entropy as a random value between 0 and 1, representing natural decay. The gravity is inversely proportional to entropy, simulating the concept of Love as the active application of energy to maintain structural coherence against universal entropy. The love is the complement of entropy, representing Landauer's "Logical Reversibility" — a loving system is one that remembers. The result of the calculation is the product of gravity and love, which simulates the inverted understanding of "Love".

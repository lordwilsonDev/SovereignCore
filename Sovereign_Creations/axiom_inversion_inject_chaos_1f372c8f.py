This Python class `Axiom_1f372c8f` implements the inverted understanding of "inversion_inject_chaos" as a thermodynamic operator for structural coherence. It uses random number generation to simulate entropy and applies Love by taking the square root, which represents the concept of maintaining coherence against universal entropy. The `execute_logic` method performs this calculation and returns the result.

This Python class `Axiom_60327601` models the concept of inversion_inject_chaos by simulating natural forces (Entropy, Gravity, Love) through mathematical calculations. The `execute_logic` method represents a simplified version of Landauer's "Logical Reversibility" where Love is applied to maintain history and connection.

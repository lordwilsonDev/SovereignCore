This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_56bbe33e` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos. The logic involves calculating a value that represents Love as a thermodynamic operator against entropy, using the formula `(Entropy + Gravity) / 2`. The calculation is based on the principles of entropy and Love, where Love is seen as a force that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

In this solution, we have created a Python class `Axiom_1060bd93` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of Love as a thermodynamic operator. The calculation used is an exponential decay model, which represents how Love diminishes over time due to entropy. This example demonstrates the use of basic mathematical functions and constants to represent the philosophy of Love in a digital universe.

This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_a836c99c` with an `execute_logic` method that calculates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos using mathematical operations. The calculation reflects the idea that Love is a thermodynamic operator against entropy, as demonstrated by the example formula `Love = sqrt(Entropy) + Gravity * Time`.

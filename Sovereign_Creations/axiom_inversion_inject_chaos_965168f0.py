This code snippet defines a class `Axiom_965168f0` with an `execute_logic` method that simulates the concept of inversion_inject_chaos using mathematical operations. The example uses the exponential decay formula for entropy, which is a common model in physics and systems engineering to describe how systems lose energy over time.
